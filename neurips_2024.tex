\title{Project Title: Exploring Representation Learning with Simple Images of Shapes}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Project Type}
Reproducing examples in the textbook

\section{Project Introduction}
{\color{red}
Please give \textbf{an introduction (1-2 paragraphs)} about your project. For example, what CVPR competition you will work on, what algorithm you are going to reproduce, what set of algorithms you are going to benchmark and on which dataset, which parts of the textbook you are going to reproduce, etc. 


Please include URL and/or reference so that I can quickly find out the corresponding references and sources. If you want to add a reference, go to Google Scholar, search for the corresponding papers, click on cite, and copy the text in BibTex into the ref.bib file. Finally, use \cite{oquab2023dinov2} to add the reference into your text. 
If you want to add a URL, do \url{https://dinov2.metademolab.com/}.

} 

In this project, we will replicate the textbook examples on autoencoders and contrastive learning, as seen here: 

\url{https://visionbook.mit.edu/representation_learning.html#experiment-do-autoencoders-learn-useful-representations}

and 

\url{https://visionbook.mit.edu/representation_learning.html#sec-representation_learning-expt_designing_embeddings_with_contrastive_learning}


\section{Project Motivation}
% {\color{red}
% Please provide an motivation about why you choose to work on this project. It may be because the problem is timely, challenging, interesting, or because you want to explore it to strengthen your computer vision skills and understanding.
% } 

This project is interesting for a couple of reasons. First, the learning model does not seem too difficult itself, so we may be able to create both models without using any machine learning libraries.  This will be a useful learning tool for understanding more about how these models work behind the scenes.  Also, exploring the different things that are possible with the encoded representations (for example, animating a transition between different shapes).

\section{Project Plan}
\subsection{Baseline approach}
% {\color{red}
% Please specify the first (i.e., baseline) computer vision technique or algorithm you will try for your project and why? What are the potential limitations of this approach? If it is a neural network, please specify its architecture, such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Residual neural network (ResNet), etc.
% } 

We will use a simple fully connected neural network as a baseline approach for our project. This is because it should be enough for our purposes, and it is simple enough that we will be able to build it ground up.  One potential limitation of this is that using a fully connected network will limit the sizes of the hidden layers.  If they were too big, the model may be too big and slow to train effectively.

\subsection{Advanced approach}
% {\color{red}
% Please specify the computer vision techniques or algorithms you will develop and/or apply beyond the baseline approach? Why do you think these advanced approaches will lead to better performance or resolve the aforementioned limitations?
% } 

Beyond this, we may add some convolutional layers to see how they impact the performance and accuracy of the model. This will allow us to have a few layers without needing to decrease layer size.  We may also add some skip connections in these early layers to emulate a ResNet, in order to explore how this chance affects accuracy.

\subsection{Validation plan}
% {\color{red}
% How will you verify the effectiveness of your approach? This can be datasets and/or specific evaluation metrics. If there are training and test data, please specify the size, for example, 10,000 images across 10 categories. Do you have access to the data?
% }

We will have a dataset of shapes with different colors, sizes, and rotations to test our network on.  We do not currently have access to this dataset, but it will be easy to generate a dataset like it.  The textbook used 64,000 images, so we will look to generate a datasest of similar size.

\subsection{Computational resources}
% {\color{red}
% What computational resources do you plan to use?
% }

This model will be simple enough to run on our own computers.

\subsection{Library, Tool, etc.}
% {\color{red}
% What will be the programming language? What will be the library or tool you plan to use (e.g., PyTorch, scikit-image)?
% }
We will write this in Python.  The main library we use will likely be either Numpy or CuPy for fast matrix operations, though we will likely write the actual neural network code ourselves.  We may also use PyTorch if we choose to go with a machine learning library.

\subsection{Estimated baseline algorithm runtime}
% {\color{red}
% Please give an estimate of the baseline algorithm's training and/or test time.
% }

We are generating the dataset ourself, and since the dataset the texbook used is not too big, we can tune the size of our images so that one epoch worth of training takes about a minute.

\section{Workload}
{\color{red}
As mentioned in the class, the final project is 30\% of your overall grade so it must contain sufficient workload (i.e., not something you can simply complete in several hours or a day.) The workload may include reading papers, get familiar with tools, organize data, implement algorithms, trial and errors, think about new ideas, etc.

Please note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to leverage any existing code and/or implementation, either as the baseline or as the building blocks of your advanced approach. It makes little sense if you keep yourself blind of the existing resources that you can leverage. 
}


\section{Ideal result}
{\color{red}
If everything is successful, what will be the outcome and result of your project, for example, achieving the best performance on CVPR 2025 competition.
}

\subsection{Insights}
{\color{red}
If you successful complete your final project, what will be the insights that you will gain?
}

\section{Potential Risk}
{\color{red}
Any potential risks that you may not complete your final project or your approach may not work? Please envision what may prevent you from completing the project. These may include your designed algorithm will not work as you expect, insufficient computational resources, etc. 
}

\section{Duplication Statement}
{\color{red}
If you choose a self-defined project, it is okay if it is related to your own research project (e.g., at your lab). However, you MUST write a short paragraph clearly articulating the difference between your final project and your own research project. More specifically, it is NOT allowed if you bring what you already planned to do in your own research project (before taking this class) as the final project.

If you plan to reproduce an existing algorithm, please clearly specify whether there are accessible code/implementation online. If so, please clearly state how your project will not just be copying the code and rerunning it.
